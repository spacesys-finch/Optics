Optics code for modelling

Note: The the labelling of curves by colour in the flux graphs is NOT consistent from graph to graph. I think this is because the modtran website is funky and stores the series in different orders from time to time. I've uploaded a Labelled Template file that you can use to see which CURVE represents which series.
